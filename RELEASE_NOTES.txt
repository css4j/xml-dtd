                            =====================

Release 3.5.2 - August 12, 2021
-------------------------------

Release Highlights
------------------

* Deprecate DefaultEntityResolver.resolveEntity(String) for removal.

  See issue #1.

* Build improvements.

  The Gradle build is smaller and a bit faster.

 If you are already using a recent version of this library, do not really need
to upgrade.


Java(tm) Runtime Environment requirements
-----------------------------------------
 All the classes in the binary package have been compiled with a Java compiler
set to 1.8 compiler compliance level, except the module-info file.

 Building the library requires a recent modular JDK (tested with version 16),
although the resulting jar file can be run with a 1.8 JRE.


Software dependencies
=====================

 The following dependencies are optional, you may need them depending on the
functionality that you are using:

- The jclf-text (5.0.0 or higher) module:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/jclf

- The tokenproducer artifact; version 1.1.1 or higher is recommended:
  https://github.com/css4j/tokenproducer/releases
